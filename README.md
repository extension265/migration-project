# migration-project
Human migration is the movement of people from one place in the world to another. Human patterns of movement reflect the conditions of a changing world and impact the cultural landscapes of both the places people leave and the places they settle.
In this project I have worked on the concept of human migration. The first step being the conversion of string variables into numeric variables, and then checking for missing values in the dataset. The missing values are replaced with the median of the given 'Values' column.
Then the data has been splitted into train and test variables. After splitting I have used RandomForestregressor algorithm for prediction. Any suggestions for the betterment of the project is highly welcomed.
